        Risotto is an Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a
        creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or
        vegetables.<br />
        Risotto in Italy is often a first course (primo), served before a second
        course (secondo), but risotto alla milanese is often served with
        ossobuco alla milanese as a one-course meal.<br />
        There are many different risotto recipes with different ingredients, but
        they are all based on rice of an appropriate variety, cooked in a
        standard procedure. Risotto, unlike other rice dishes, requires constant
        care and attention. The rice is not to be pre-rinsed, boiled, or
        drained, as washing would remove much of the starch required for a
        creamy texture.
