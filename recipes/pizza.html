        Pizza is a traditional Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base
        of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other
        ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
        oven. <br />
        The term pizza was first recorded in the year 997 AD, in a Latin
        manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the
        border with Campania. Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating
        modern pizza in Naples. In 2009, Neapolitan pizza was registered with
        the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In
        2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was added to UNESCO's list of
        intangible cultural heritage.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>½ (12 ounce) can CONTADINA Tomato Paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
      <li>
        2 (.25 ounce) envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise
        Yeast
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
      <li>⅓ cup oil</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) package HORMEL Pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch
        pizza pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic
        powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until
        smooth. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large
        bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute.
        Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky
        dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and
        elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise
        yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of
        dough onto the prepared pizza pans.
      </li>
      <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is
        bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom
        oven racks halfway through baking.
      </li>
